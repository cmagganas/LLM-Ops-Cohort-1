It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 0}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: imseeg\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: 3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.\\nReview: The first reason to go see it:\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 1}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: Natcat87\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Too heavy handed\\nReview: As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain\\'t the way to get it.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 2}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 31 July 2023\\nAuthor: ramair350\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that\\'s ok.\\nReview: As much as it pains me to give a movie called \"Barbie\" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I\\'m a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don\\'t agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that\\'s ok. This movie wasn\\'t designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I\\'ll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 3}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: heatherhilgers\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: A Technicolor Dream\\nReview: Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way.

And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for.

Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 16}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 26 July 2023\\nAuthor: aherdofbeautifulwildponies\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: A Hot Pink Mess\\nReview: Before making Barbie (2023),\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 17}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: finnconnelly-63017\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Ken out of ten\\nReview: Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 18}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: andermic18\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: No Direction\\nReview: The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 19}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: Genti25\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: You are Kenough\\nReview: This movie is so much fun.

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 31}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: MaskedMinty\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Preach Preach Preach\\nReview: Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It\\'s clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner\\'s feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person\\'s life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 40}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: mr_bickle_the_pickle\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Life in plastic, it's fantastic!\\nReview: It's an incredibly fun movie.

And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 52}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: shadowtramp\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: More of a marketing flick\\nReview: The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets.

Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer.

A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none.

The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up.

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 63}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: fernandoschiavi\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: \"Barbie\" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy\\nReview: Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 64}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: anniebleasdale-97708\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.\\nReview: Unfortunately, most reviews that I\\'ve read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn\\'t offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 65}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: MatthewMichaelHoffman\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Fails to meet expectations, but still fun!\\nReview: SCORE: 7.8/10\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 66}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 3 August 2023\\nAuthor: DanLawson146\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Fun, but too on the nose at times\\nReview: POSITIVES:\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 67}), Document(page_content=\"Review_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: PedroPires90\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: A triumph\\nReview: I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films.

I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 41}), Document(page_content='Review_Date: 1 August 2023\\nAuthor: badreviewer\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: This Barbie is dissapointed.\\nReview: Yes.

As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers.

It starts off really strong although the story does move away from \"Barbieland\" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling\\'s portrayal of Ken.

It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn\\'t offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 65}),\n",

The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv\", metadata={'source': '/review/rw9201978/?ref_=tt_urv', 'row': 61})]}"
